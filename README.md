# 🐍 Scripts Collection

Welcome to my **Scripts** repository!  
Here I store and share various Python scripts and small automation projects.

Each script is organized in its own folder, with separate README files explaining their functionality and usage.

## 📂 Projects inside:

### 🔍 [`findvirus/`](./findvirus)

Useful for detecting suspicious activity or recent changes in website/server files.

### 📁 [`directory/`](./directory)


A Python script for working with directories and files.  
Currently supports renaming files in a directory based on specified patterns.

## 📝 How to use:

Navigate to the folder of the script you want, and follow the instructions in its `README.md`.

All scripts are written in **Python 3.x** and tested locally.
